A simple AutoHotKey script to control recoil for Counter Strike 2

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**

This project is currently under active development.  
The core architecture is in place (profile handling, hotkeys, global state management, minimal UI),  
but some features are still experimental or incomplete.

## Current Status

- Dynamic profile loading (`profiles/*.profile`)
- Configurable hotkey system via INI files
- Centralized state management
- Minimal, lightweight UI for status display
- Modular project structure (`core / config / profiles`)

## Notes

- Behavior and features may change over time
- Parts of the codebase may be refactored
- The project is not considered stable yet

## Roadmap (indicative)

- Profile system stabilization
- UI improvements
- Code cleanup and refactoring
- More weapons handler
